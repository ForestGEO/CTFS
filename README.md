[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/forestgeo/ctfs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/forestgeo/ctfs)

`ctfs-dev`
==========

The goal of `ctfs` is to provide tools for the analysis of forest dynamics. The target audience is the [ForestGEO](http://www.forestgeo.si.edu/) community.

Specifically, `ctfs-dev` provides an "asis" verson of its original predecesor CTFS, but `ctfs` is built as an R Package sensu stricto, so it can be loaded with `library(ctfs)`.

Installation
------------

-   The original CTFS package is available [here](http://ctfs.si.edu/Public/CTFSRPackage/).

Installation with `install_github_` currently fails, but you can download the file `ctfs_<VERSION>.tar` from [this Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5fCyFlg2t4pVGl0Zmp0QTVQZTQ/view) and then install it from the Packages tab of RStudio as shown below (then run `library(ctfs)`):
