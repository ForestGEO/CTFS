#' @param export `export = "no"`, does nothing, so the next graph uses the
#'   default R device. With this option, the size of the graph cannot have been
#'   set larger than the default size, which is usually 7 inches. `export =
#'   "unix"`, a new graphics window in unix, size `h` and width `w`, will be
#'   opened allowing you to alter the size of the output. `export = "windows"`,
#'   or `export = "mac"` are similar to `export = "unix"` but for windows and
#'   mac. `export = format` exports the graph to a specific file format: "pdf",
#'   "png", "jpg", "bmp", "emf".
