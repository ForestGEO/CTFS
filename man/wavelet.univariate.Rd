\description{
Function to calculate the univariate wavelet variance using furier transforms.

It accepts a raster data or a point pattern, which is the default if raster is not provided.

The wavelet variance describes the spatial autocorrelation or aggregation of tree distribution.

A wavelet variance greater than 1 indicates scales at which individuals
are aggregated. A wavelet variance less than 1, indicates scales at which
individuals are dis-aggregated. A wavelet variance equal to 1, indicates scales
at which individuals are randomply distribuited (as Poisson process).

A graphical test is implemented on the null hypothesis of complete randomness.

If the wavelet variance is out of the conf bounds the tree distribution
is significantly different from a random process.

Dependencies: needs the package 'spatstat'and the CTFSRpackage

Authors: Matteo Detto and Tania Brenes

Output: a list containing vectors for the wavelet variance, the scale of the wavelet variance, the normalized variance, and the confidence intervals.

raster (NULL): used if data is entered already as a raster matrix
coords  (): an alternate to a raster table, a table with two (or three) columns giving coordinates x, y (and an optional mark) in that order. This is used to calculate a raster;
gridsize : is the quadrat size of the rasterization;
plotdim (c(1000,500)): the dimensions of the plot;

FUN (NULL): function to apply to the marked point pattern, if function is not specified (default) it counts points. E.g. can be used to sum the basal areas or above graound biomass
k0 (8): numeric. smoothing parameter of the wavelet filter (k0 between 5.5-15), lower values of k0 produce a smoother wavelet variance;
dj  (0.15):  numeric. discretization of the scale axis;
graph (FALSE): logical. If TRUE, plots the wavelet variace as a function of scale
