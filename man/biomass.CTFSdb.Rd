\usage{
biomass.CTFSdb(RStemTable, RTreeTable, whichtable = "tree", dbhunit = "mm",
  plot = "bci", wsgdata = wsg.ctfs2, forest = "moist", ht.param = NULL,
  htmodel = predht.asym, useChave = TRUE, cnsno = NULL, dbname = NULL,
  fullname = NULL, plotcode = NULL)
}
\description{
Calculate biomass from existing R-formatted tables for trees and stems using dbh allometry. By default, it uses the Chave (2005) equations.

Note that the standard downloads of R Analytical Tables, already has the agb column filled, calculated with this routine using the default parameters for moist forest. 

This program can be used to repeat or redo the calculation. It can also be used for other tables, always requiring two tables:  one with trees and one with all stems. 

The function returns the same table as submitted (either tree or stem), with a column agb added; if the agb column was already present, it is replaced. 

Calculations are done by AGB.ind and the subroutines it call.

An alternative option is to have AGB calculations already stored in the server's AGB database, setting useChave=FALSE. This function then looks up the AGB for 
each stem from the table named for the plot. 


RStemTable: Name of table with one row per stem; must have dbh, species (column sp), treeID

RTreeTable: Name of table with one row per tree; must have dbh, species (column sp), treeID
whichtable: Set to "tree" to return the entire tree table with agb, or to "stem" to return stem table
dbhunit: Set to "mm", "cm", or "inch"
plot: Name of plot, matching the plot name used in the wood-density table
wsgdata: Name of R object having wood-density for species in all CTFS plots
forest: Set to "moist", "dry", or "wet" to use the equations publshed in Chave (2005) for the 3 forest types
ht.param: A vector of parameters for a formula relating tree height to dbh; if NULL, the biomass formula does not use height
htmodel: Name of an R function that returns tree height giving a dbh and any number of parameters; if ht.param is NULL, htmodel is ignored
