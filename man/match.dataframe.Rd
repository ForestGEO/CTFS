\title{Matches two dataframes using two or more columns. Rs function match...}
\usage{
match.dataframe(x, y)
}
\description{
Matches two dataframes using two or more columns. R's function match() works only on vectors
(and thus single columns only). The return is a vector of indices, exactly as match() does.
}
