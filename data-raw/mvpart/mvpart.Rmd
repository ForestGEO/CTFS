# Installation

The __mvpart__ package is no longer active on CRAN but can be installed from the archives.

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cran/mvpart")
```

Or download a realease from https://github.com/cran/mvpart/releases and install it with something like:

```R
install.packages(
  "C:/Users/dora/Desktop/mvpart-1.6-2.tar.gz", 
  repos = NULL, type = "source"
)
```

Some people reported installation issues (https://goo.gl/oDjjz8).



# Data

- Tutorial https://goo.gl/zDLdMi
- Data from Stuart Davies (https://goo.gl/NszXEi).

```{r load-data, include=FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
KC3spp20 <- read_csv_alt("KC3spp20.csv", "./data-raw/mvpart/KC3spp20.csv")
kc.hab <- read_csv_alt("kc.hab.csv", "./data-raw/mvpart/kc.hab.csv")
```



## Overview data

2 files attached:

- KC3spp20 – is the species matrix of abundance in each of 600 quadrats

```{r}
# See a few columns from the beginning, middle and end
KC3spp20 %>% dplyr::select(1:2, 250:252, 583:585)

# For a cleaner output for interpretation, normalized tree spp data to a mean of
# 0 and standard deviation of 1 (https://goo.gl/zDLdMi).
```

- kc.hab – a bunch of habitat variables for the same 600 quadrats

```{r}
kc.hab %>% dplyr::glimpse()
```

# Results

In this section, we first explore one result in detail; then we'll re-run the exact same model twice more and we'll compare the results.

## Build and run the model

```{r mvpart-run1, fig.height=14, fig.width=12}
abundance <- data.matrix(KC3spp20)
environmental_variables <- kc.hab

formula <- abundance ~ RB_NO3 + RB_NH4 + RB_PO4 + Al + pH_water + Na + Mn + 
  Mg + K + Fe + Ca + BS + ECEC + Bray_P + meanelev + convex + slope

# Set a new seed for random numbers to ensure results are reproducible
set.seed(1221)

# See `?mvpart()` for argument details
mvpart_run1 <- mvpart(
  form = formula, 
  data = environmental_variables,
  all.leaves = TRUE,  # annotate all nodes
  rsq = TRUE,  # give "rsq" plot
  pca = TRUE,  # plot PCA of group means and add species and site information
  wgt.ave.pca = TRUE  # plot weighted averages acorss sites for species
)
```

# Evaluation

## Compare multiple runs of the same model

__Two runs of the same model are different because the algorithm uses random numbers.__

```{r compare-run, fig.height=14, fig.width=12}
set.seed(1234)  # Set a new seed for random numbers
mvpart_run2 <- mvpart(form = formula, data = environmental_variables)
# Set a different seed and re-run the exact same model
set.seed(4321)  
mvpart_run3 <- mvpart(form = formula, data = environmental_variables)
# compare all models run
all.equal(mvpart_run1, mvpart_run2)
all.equal(mvpart_run1, mvpart_run3)
all.equal(mvpart_run2, mvpart_run3)
```

## `mvpart()` fails with scaled abundance data

```
The clustering actually is weird. It groups the top of the hill and the bottom
of the hill (red and green on the map) together in the second split. The
species are really different between these habitats, which suggests there is
an error.

The classification tree seems to be entirely driven by the soils, and the
species don’t carry much weight.

I wonder if the results would differ after scaling the species data (scale function in base package).
```

> These are data for each tree species __normalized to a mean of 0 and standard    deviation of 1__, which creates a cleaner output for interpretation

--https://goo.gl/zDLdMi

```{r}
# Standarize

abundance <- data.matrix(KC3spp20)
abund_scaled <- scale(abundance)

# Ad-hoc function to check that all columns have mean = 0 and sd = 1
are_all_columns_near <- function(.data, .near, .f) {
  # Arguments:
  #   .data: Dataframe or matrix.
  #   .near: Scalar.
  #   .f: Summary function such as mean and sd to apply to all columns of data.
  # Value:
  #   Returns TRUE if all columns are near .near; FALSE otherwise.
  .data %>% 
    as_tibble() %>%
    summarise_all(.f) %>% 
    purrr::map(dplyr::near, .near) %>%
    as.logical() %>% 
    all()
}
abundance %>% are_all_columns_near(0, mean)
abund_scaled %>% are_all_columns_near(0, mean)
abundance %>% are_all_columns_near(1, sd)
abund_scaled %>% are_all_columns_near(1, sd)
```

```{r, error=TRUE}
# Re-run analysis that resulted in mvpart_run1

formula_scaled <- abund_scaled ~ RB_NO3 + RB_NH4 + RB_PO4 + Al + pH_water +
  Na + Mn + Mg + K + Fe + Ca + BS + ECEC + Bray_P + meanelev + convex + slope

set.seed(1221) # same seed as for mvpart_run1

# This one fails
mvpart_run1_scaled <- mvpart(
  form = formula_scaled, 
  data = environmental_variables,
  all.leaves = TRUE,  # annotate all nodes
  rsq = TRUE,  # give "rsq" plot
  pca = TRUE,  # plot PCA of group means and add species and site information
  wgt.ave.pca = TRUE  # plot weighted averages acorss sites for species
)
```

The scaled data fails. Repeating mvpart_run1 to check it runs again:

```{r, fig.height=14, fig.width=12}
<<mvpart-run1>>
```



# Miscelaneas

## Package __rpart__ does not handle multi variate data

The __rpart__ package seems like a good alternative because `?mvpart::mvpart()` says it's a wrapper of `rpart()`. However, `mvpart::rpart()` works with multivariate data, but `rpart::rpart()` does not. 

```R
mvpart::rpart(form = formula, data = environmental_variables)  # passes
rpart::rpart(form = formula, data = environmental_variables)  # fails
```

__rpart__ is active but __mvpart__ is not. Maybe the authors can inform where else __mvpart__ functions can be found.

Access __rpart__'s vignettes from R with:
