The question addressed here is how growth has changed with time, in particular how species differ in growth changes. There are two alternative models described:

* Growth rate changing linearly with time
* Growth rate varying from census to census, but not following a consistent change

Both hypotheses will be tested running models with the R function lmer in the package lme4.

```{r}
# install.packages("lme4")
library(lme4)
```


You will need to install the package.
