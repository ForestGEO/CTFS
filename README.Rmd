# ctfs (deprecated): Code form the CTFS R Package <img src="https://i.imgur.com/39pvr4n.png" align="right" height=44 />

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/forestgeo/ctfs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/forestgeo/ctfs)
[![Coverage status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/forestgeo/ctfs/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/forestgeo/ctfs?branch=master)
[![CRAN status](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/ctfs)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ctfs)

__ctfs__ is not maintained.

### Installation

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("forestgeo/ctfs")
```

### Differences between ctfs and the CTFS R package

* Function names: replaced "." by "_" in the names of some functions to overcome conflicts with R's S3 system (http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html#s3).

* Documentation: edited some documentation to make it clearer, or added documentation that was missing (e.g. some arguments where documented in some but not all functions that used those arguments).

* __ctfs__ is an R package __sensu stricto__, but not the CTFS R Package. 

    * To install __ctfs__ see the section _Installation_ and to learn how to use it see help files as you would normally do for any R package, i.e. with `help(FUNCTION)` or `?FUNCTION`. Alternatively, go to https://forestgeo.github.io/ctfs/.
    
    * To install the CTFS R Package and to learn how to use it, go to http://ctfs.si.edu/Public/CTFSRPackage/.

* Added some functions, to facilitate development. E.g. to identidy undocumented arguments, or to build a website automatically. These funcitons are in `R/ft-*.R`, where `*` is anything. These functions depend on some packages additional to those on which the original CTFS R Package depend (such packages are now declared in `DESCRIPTIONS`, under `Imports:` or `Suggests:`).
