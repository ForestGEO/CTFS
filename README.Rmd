ctfs provides the original CTFS R Package (Richard Condit) with the structure of an R package _sensu stricto_ (with some hacks). After you install it, functions will be available with `<FUNCTION_NAME>`; and documentation with `?<FUNCTION_NAME>`, `help(<FUNCTION_NAME>)` or online at https://forestgeo.github.io/ctfs/ or http://ctfs.si.edu/Public/CTFSRPackage/.

## Installation

If you are authorized (via [Stuart Davies](daviess@si.edu)), you can install ctfs from ForestGEO's private GitHub repo.

```
# From ?devtools::install_github:
# To install from a private repo, use auth_token with a token
# from https://github.com/settings/tokens. You only need the
# repo scope. Best practice is to save your PAT in env var called
# GITHUB_PAT.

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("forestgeo/ctfs", auth_token = "<YOUR_TOKEN>")
library(ctfs)
```
