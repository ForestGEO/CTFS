# ctfs

The CTFS R Package includes a wide variety of R functions aimed at analysis of data from CTFS forest census plots. Most of the functions use the CTFS R Analytical tables, which are tables of plot data organizing tree and stem measurements in a precise format. The Package also includes many supporting functions that carry out basic, oft-used calculations, such as date conversion, geometry, model-fitting, probability distributions, and rearrangment of R data objects.



### Installation

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("forestgeo/ctfs")
```



### Acknowledgments

The CTFS R Package was developed with the support of NSF grant #1046113 to Stuart J. Davies through the NSF-IRCN program on the Dimensions of Biodiversity.
