[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/forestgeo/ctfs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/forestgeo/ctfs)


# `ctfs-dev`

The goal of `ctfs` is to provide tools for the analysis of forest dynamics. The target audience is the [ForestGEO](http://www.forestgeo.si.edu/) community.

Specifically,  `ctfs-dev` provides an "asis" verson of its original predecesor CTFS, but `ctfs` is built as an R Package sensu stricto, so it can be loaded with `library(ctfs)`.


## Installation

- The original CTFS package is available [here](http://ctfs.si.edu/Public/CTFSRPackage/). 

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# - To install `ctfs-dev` from GitHub with:
# 
# ```R
# # insltall.packages("devtools")
# # Install branch dev
# devtools::install_github("forestgeo/ctfs", ref = "dev")
# ```
# 
# To install from a private GitHub repository follow instructions in `?install_github`.
# 
# ```r
# # To install from a private repo, use auth_token with a token
# # from https://github.com/settings/tokens. You only need the
# # repo scope. Best practice is to save your PAT in env var called
# # GITHUB_PAT.
# install_github("hadley/private", auth_token = "abc")
# ```
```

Installation with `install_github_` currently fails, but you can download the file `ctfs_<VERSION>.tar` from [this Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5fCyFlg2t4pVGl0Zmp0QTVQZTQ/view) and then install it from the Packages tab of RStudio as shown below (then run `library(ctfs)`):
