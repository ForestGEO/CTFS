# ctfs

The goal of `ctfs` is to provide tools for the analysis of forest dynamics. The target audience is the [ForestGEO](http://www.forestgeo.si.edu/) community.

## Installation

The original package is available [here](http://ctfs.si.edu/Public/CTFSRPackage/). Or install `ctfs` from GitHub with:

```R
# insltall.packages("devtools")
# Install branch dev
devtools::install_github("forestgeo/ctfs", ref = "dev")
```

To install from a private GitHub repository follow instructions in `?install_github`.

```r
# To install from a private repo, use auth_token with a token
# from https://github.com/settings/tokens. You only need the
# repo scope. Best practice is to save your PAT in env var called
# GITHUB_PAT.
install_github("hadley/private", auth_token = "abc")
```
