Description: Tools for the analysis of forest dynamics. __ctfs__ is almost 
    identical to the CTFS R Package (http://ctfs.si.edu/Public/CTFSRPackage/).
    In __ctfs__ "_" replaces "." in the name of a few functions, and some
    documentation was slightly edited or added. __ctfs__ includes a
    wide variety of R functions aimed at analysis of data from CTFS forest 
    census plots. Most of the functions use the CTFS R Analytical tables, which
    are tables of plot data organizing tree and stem measurements in a precise
    format. The Package also includes many supporting functions that carry out
    basic, oft-used calculations, such as date conversion, geometry, 
    model-fitting, probability distributions, and rearrangement of R data 
    objects.
